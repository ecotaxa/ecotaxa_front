EcoTaxa is a web application dedicated to the visual exploration and the taxonomic annotation of images that illustrate
the beauty of planktonic biodiversity.

This is the front-end part of the application, which is (nearly) stateless and takes/writes all data from EcoTaxa
back-end (in https://github.com/ecotaxa/ecotaxa_back). See this project's instructions for setup.

Please read the documentation.

To start, provided that you have a proper running back-end, you must create a short file `config/config.cfg`.
You can use `appli/config-model.cfg` as template.

This project is tested with BrowserStack.
