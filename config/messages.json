These pages are meant to become available directly from EcoTaxa.\r\nThis is a Beta version and improvements are ongoing. Our team has already populated the application with many taxa as seen on ZooScan images and has begun the same work for UVP and Flowcam/Planktoscope images. If you do not find your taxon/instrument of interest, you can register and create it. Be sure to read the embedded HOW TO page first and please contact <a href=\"mailto:piqv@imev-mer.fr\">piqv@imev-mer.fr</a> for better coordination.\r\nWe hope that this resource will prove useful!\r\n<a href=\"https://ecotaxoguide.imev-mer.fr/\" style=\"color:#34a7ad\">https://ecotaxoguide.imev-mer.fr/</a>\r\n\r\nLatest count of objects in EcoTaxa: 518 millions!\r\nThe new Zooprocess 8.27 is available.
