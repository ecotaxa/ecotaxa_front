--------- TODO --------------

- back-end uses the same DB sequence as EcoPart temp tasks -> fork the sequence... or not as whole DB will be forked.

- separate temptasks directory for jobs vs tasks -> necessary as precisely, the sequences will evolve in //

- "EcoTaxa folder temptask/task%06d (useful for huge files)"

----------- DONE -------------

- refs to acquisitions table in SQL (1 match)
- refs to obj_head table in SQL (1 match)
- refs to obj_fields in SQL (1 match)

- refs to samples table in SQL (1 match)

- ref to users_roles in SQL (for listing role 2, a single generic mail PIQv for prod')

- also kept in part_ DB tables (part_projects.owner_id) -> OK as EcoTaxa is authority

- refs to users table in SQL (1 match)

- refs to projectspriv table in SQL for asserting current user rights on EcoTaxa projects (1 match)

- refs to part_samples.project SQLAlchemy relation (2 matches in sampleedit.py) -> OK it's a relation to part_projects

- ref to database.Projects SQLAlchemy wrapper (1 match, /!\ 1 create in part_prjedit)
- ref to database.ProjectsPriv SQLAlchemy wrapper (1 match, /!\ 1 create in part_prjedit)
- ref to projects table in SQL (1 match: part_prjedit)

- refs to taxonomy DB table (1 match in GlobalTaxoCompute AKA cron)
- refs to objects DB view (1 match in GlobalTaxoCompute AKA cron)

- move temp_tasks to EcoPart DB definition

- Remove ForeignKey calls

- finish replacements of /part with {{ url_for() }}

- split manager.py -> EcoPart sequences to recompute

- config file, adding back-end URL (_hardcoded_ for now) - bah it's a single-site installation

- cron.py for EcoPart

------------ ISSUES ---------------

- connection to EcoTaxa by background process: no cookie, generally speaking which user to take?
-> Create an admin EcoPart user?
-> Command-line or cookie in env.

-------- ARCH --------------

- DB table temp_tasks belongs to EcoPart

- login delegate to EcoTaxa
