  <hr>
  Similarity search function will find, in EcoTaxa, objects which are visually similar to a given (called 'seed') one.
  <br>
  Each search result materializes as an added <i>sort order</i> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-sort"></span> option. When this option is selected, visually similar objects will be displayed near the seed.
  <br>
  <br>Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>The added sort orders are not sensitive to sort direction, always <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-sort-by-attributes-alt"></span>.
    </li>
    <li>Searches are not saved in your preferences, they vanish if the page is reloaded.
    </li>
    <li>Like any other sort order, similarity search can be sent via 'Share Page' option.
    </li>
    <li>If not filtered out, the 'seed' appears as the first (top left) image of the result, with <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-grain'></span> sign.
    </li>
    <li>If filtered, the 'seed' does not appear in the result, but similarity order is still active. It can be useful in some situations.
    </li>
  </ul>
